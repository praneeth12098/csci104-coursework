Few Notes:
	-In order to re sort the search results with the new review ratings taken into consideration you must hit the go button again so it will update the products with the new ratings.
	-In order to submit a review, you must enter a valid rating, everything else is not checked. Then you must hit submit review. Then click close.
	-In order to see the reflected review additions, you must click refresh reviews. Then you can see the review that you submitted for the product.
	-The user cart does not update if you add to cart. You have to close the existing cart and then click view cart again to see the updated cart (it said this was fine in the instructions).
	-Saving is just clicking save and inputting the file name.
	-It should compile perfectly fine with just qmake, and then make. Although if this doesn't work then just run qmake -project first and it should work.  
	-Other than that, have fun shopping at 'The OG Market'! Thank you!
